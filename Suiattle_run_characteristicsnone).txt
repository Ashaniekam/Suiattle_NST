This code is running for scenario 1
This is the tau_c_multiplier 2.4
This is the number of timesteps 50
The number of days in each timestep is 0.3333333333333333
The pulse is added at timestep 2
The volume of each pulse parcel is 25
This is the number of pulse parcels added to the network 5353
The current stage of this code is editing variables to be normalized since steady state.
